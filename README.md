# Light up diatonic keys

The standard pianoforte with recessed black keys makes it easy to play in diatonic, equal-temperament key-of-C. Every other key is hard. G has one sharp; D has two sharps; B has five sharps. Even to explain what "has sharps" means is a mouthful.

This code is meant to hook into an instrument with *undifferentiated* keys / frets / stringboards, each of which can be lit from below.

Taking (for starters) input from a knob, the program defines which keys (for starters) in an 88-key "piano" to light up[B[B
the (for starters) diatonic notes. Turning the knob changes the "key" (ambiguous word but here I refer to the which-sharps-and-flats key), which defines which "keys" (hammers) should be back-lit.


A button can switch between diatonic and pentatonic.


Later we can add more instruments (eg, guitar; violin).


## Raspberry pi / arduino

Need to find a library to hook the hardware in.



## Keys

Need to find undifferentiated keys that can be back-lit.
